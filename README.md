# Marmalade Bridge tools

JS library and Dapp for working with Marmalade NG Bridge.

## marmalade-ng-bridge

Main and "low level" JS library. Works directly from Marmalade contracts for
gathering tokens data and generating transactions.

This library is still WIP and API can still change a lot.


## marmalade-ng-bridge-dapp

React web Dapp for creating a relatively user friendly UX for Marmalade Bridge.

Tested:
- Token Upgrade
- X-chain Token Transfers

No tested but expcted to work:
- Generic to NG transfers
- X-NG ledgers transfers

Not working:
- V1 -> NG transfers.
